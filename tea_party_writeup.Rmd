```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The Problem

We are having a party with amounts of tea and candy. Return the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great. A party is good (1) if both tea and candy are at least 5. However, if either tea or candy is at least double the amount of the other one, the party is great (2). However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party is always bad (0).

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
